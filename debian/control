Description: Real-Time Utilities for EPICS IOCs on Multi-Core Linux
 The EPICS Multi-Core Utilities library contains tools that allow tweaking of
 real-time parameters for EPICS IOC threads running on multi-core processors
 under the Linux operating system.
 .
 These tools are intended to set up multi-core IOCs for fast controllers, by:
  * Confining either parts or the complete EPICS IOC onto a subset of the
    available cores, allowing hard real-time applications and threads to run on
    dedicated cores.
  * Changing priorities of callback, driver or communication threads with
    respect to database processing.
  * Selecting real-time scheduling policy (FIFO or Round-Robin) for selected
    threads.
  * Locking the IOC process virtual memory into RAM to avoid swapping.
 .
 This package contains the header files.
