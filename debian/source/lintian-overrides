# Doxygen is building their "jquery.js" file from a bunch of minified
# libraries. They are combining them as required in their C++ code. This
# means (a) the resulting file contains more than jquery itself and
# (b) it is minified making it hard to get _the_ source file.
# The Lintian guys have decided to whitelist jquery.js if it is contained
# in a Doxygen directory (see https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=736360
# for details). Until this change has been released we override this error.
